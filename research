Static players Header:

start offset: 0x402AAF90 (0x20 long)
MaxSlot: 

Offset to x-coord from start of static player struct: 0xF8


Offset to object num from start of static player struct: 0x34
Offset to object ID from start of static player struct: 0x36

Dynamic Object Array:
Start: 0x400506E8
Size: 0xC
Offset Loc: 0x400506E8 + 0xC * ObjectNumber + 0x8

Dynamic Player Object:
xCoordAddress = playerAddress + 0x5C
yCoordAddress = xCoordAddress + 0x4
zCoordAddress = zCoordAddress + 0x8

xVelocityAddress = xCoordAddress + 0xC
yVelocityAddress = xCoordAddress + 0x10
zVelocityAddress = zCoordAddress + 0x14

isCrouching = playerAddress + 0x208 
	=> isCrouching == 0, standing
	=> isCrouching == 1, crouching
	=> isCrouching == 2, jumping

Static Player Struct Header:
First Player Structure Address: 0x402AAFC8

Static Player Struct:
dynamicObjectNumberAddress = playerStructureAddress + 0x34
dynamicObjectIDAddress = playerStructureAddres + 0x36

playerObjectID = readUInt16(dynamicObjectIDAddress)
if (playerObjectID != 0 && playerObjectID != 0xFFFF) it should be a real player

SO!

For each player in the static structure, 
dynamicPlayerLookupAddress = 0x400506E8 + 0xC * readUInt16(dynamicObjectNumberAddress) 
dynamicPlayerID = readUInt16(dynamicPlayerLookupAddress)
if (dynamicPlayerID == readUInt16(dynamicObjectIDAddress)) it's all good
